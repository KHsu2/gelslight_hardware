## Manufacture

#### Supplies required
###### Chemicals
* Ease Release 200
* Silicones, Inc. XP-565
* Yellow Print-On Silicone Ink
* Print-On Silicone Ink diluent
* Clear PLA 3D printer filament
* ?mm transparent acrylic
* Gray Print-On Silicone Ink
* Acrylic glue
* Silicone glue
###### Tools(?)
* Petri dish
* Pour boats
* Popsicle mixing sticks

#### Equipment required
* Fume hood *(if available)*
* Vacuum chamber
* Toaster oven
* 3D printer
* Laser cutter

A vacuum chamber and toaster oven have been stored in ECE B031 ("silicone lab"), but check with the current project owner for the current location. There are multiple makerspaces on campus which have 3D printers and laser cutters; the two most accessible are the MILL in McCarty Hall and CoMotion Makerspace in Fluke Hall.

### Procedure
#### 1. Silicone lab
* __Cast transparent gel silicone__: Spray petri dish with Ease Release 200. Mix 15g XP-565 in pour boat, then pour into dish. Vacuum until no bubbles remain, then heat on warm for 10 min.
* __Add yellow layer while XP-565__: Starting with a pinkie-tip quantitiy of yellow Silicone Ink, mix in a 1:10:60 activator:ink:diluent ratio. The resulting mixture should be approximately the consistency of chocolate milk. Pour in a thin even layer over the XP-565 petri dish. The layer should be as thin as possible, so you will not use all of the yellow silicone. Heat the dish on warm for 15 min.
#### 2. Makerspace
* **Print cores**: Print open side up in clear PLA with 0.2mm layer height, raft, and no support.
* **Laser cut acrylic**: Print [filename] 8s 100p 100f vector.
* **Laser cut and engrave gel**: 11s 4p 50f raster, 5s 75p 50f vector.
#### 3. Silicone lab
